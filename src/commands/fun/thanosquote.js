  " Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.",
  "Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that." +
  " You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",
  "I ignored my destiny once, I can not do that again. Even for you. I'm sorry little one.",

  "I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me, but the work is done. It always will be. I'm inevitable.",
  "You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.",
  "Reality is often disappointing.",
  "A small price to pay for salvation."
